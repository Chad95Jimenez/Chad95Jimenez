## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a software engineer with a strong background in embedded systems and C++, and Iâ€™m currently expanding my expertise into the world of web development. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a solid foundation in low-level programming and working with hardware, where Iâ€™ve designed and optimized embedded systems for a variety of applications. However, my passion for coding and technology has led me to explore the dynamic and fast-evolving world of web development.

As I transition into this new area, Iâ€™m focusing on learning key web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. My goal is to build robust and interactive web applications that are both user-friendly and performant. The problem-solving skills I developed in embedded systems, such as working with memory constraints, optimizing for speed, and ensuring system reliability, have proven invaluable as I apply them to web development challenges.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a collection of my projects that reflect this journey of growth and exploration. Whether itâ€™s working on front-end development or diving into back-end technologies, Iâ€™m excited to share my progress and the lessons learned along the way. Iâ€™m particularly interested in creating scalable, maintainable web applications that deliver seamless experiences, leveraging both my low-level programming knowledge and new web development skills.

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration from fellow developers as I continue to build on my web development skills. Thanks for visiting my repositoryâ€”feel free to explore my work, and I look forward to connecting with others in the community!
